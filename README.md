# Mama: A simple command line tool

## Why?
This tool was built using internal usage using [go](https://golang.org/) programming language.

During product development, sometimes we need to clear all old data from our system to start new testing. That time, we faced some issues, like we need Postgres client, MySQL client, Postman to use API. Instead of that, we can make our own command to handle this situation.

Example:
```
$ mama delete enrolment --msisdn=088017XXXXXXXX
```

I have added some examples here. If anyone interested they use it for their purpose.
